# XanCraft21_ST7687
Arduino library to drive the DFRobot 2.2 inch 128x128 round TFT LCD display with ST7687S driver.

This library uses Adafruit_GFX and must be installed with this library in order for this to work.

This display is getting very hard to find online and may be discontinued.
If you can find the display by itself, it may be possible to make your own with a 74HC595 shift register.
As of right now the only place to get this display by itself is only one seller on AliExpress, coming from china.
I will send a link to the bare display once i get around to it.

Most of the credit goes to Adafruit for their graphics library and to DFRobot for their original library code.

WARNING: THIS LIBRARY IS CURRENTLY UNFINISHED! SOME FUNCTIONS ARE CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE AND WILL BE ADDED IN THE FUTURE!
